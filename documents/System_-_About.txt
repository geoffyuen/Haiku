### Audience

- Mac users using Safari, Firefox and Chrome

### Quick and dirty!

Tested on Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer 8.

Backend tested on Apache (Ubuntu 11.04, OS X 10.6) and PHP. No guarantees on how it works on IIS - probably not well at all.

This CMS contains an index.php and markdown.php from <http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/>. That's it. No databases to mess around with.
