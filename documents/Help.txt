You can add new articles by clicking the New+ button. This will bring up an editor in which you can fill out all or some information. You must enter a Company Name as this will be used as a filename that the information will be saved under. Once saved, a page link will be located in the navigation list.

There's also an edit button at the end of all articles. Clicking on it will bring up the editor. The *Notes* area allows you to enter certain codes to style your text using a system called Markdown. It's designed to be readable as plain text but when interpreted by the system it applies predetermined styles to beautify it. Some styles are applied to an entire paragraph or a selection of characters - much like InDesign paragraph/character styles. Any line that begins with a *special* character is probably applied to the entire paragraph.

    If you see text on a yellow background it means that you're supposed to type this code like you see it.
