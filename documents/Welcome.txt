This website *was* meant to store information about the many printers and suppliers we use. Please record information such as FTP logins, pdf specifications, dieline formats, etc so all of use can share in the knowledge. But also use it to keep records of stock photo site logins, design related Youtube videos, website links or anything else you can think of.
